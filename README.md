# Mai Dung - Data Analysis Portfolio


## Introduction
Hello, and welcome to my data analyst portfolio. I'm **Mai Dung - the Aspiring Data Analyst**, and I'm thrilled to have you here.

Within this collection of projects, you'll discover my passion for data exploration, statistical analysis, data visualization, and effective data presentation. These are just a few of the skills I've honed along my data journey. The majority of my projects leverage SQL, PowerBI, and Excel to uncover insights and tell data-driven stories. In this README, I'll provide a concise overview of my background and aspirations in data science, as well as a glimpse into my future projects.

## About & Data Journey
With a Bachelor of Business degree in Marketing from Western Sydney University, my journey into the world of data analysis started with a deep appreciation for understanding consumer behavior and market trends. I quickly realized the power of data in uncovering patterns, predicting outcomes, and driving strategic decision-making. This fascination led me to pursue roles where I could combine my marketing expertise with analytical skills, ultimately carving a path toward becoming a data-driven professional.

As a self-learner, I've embarked on a path to develop and enhance my data skills, building upon my foundation in marketing. My goal is to continue learning in the field of data and, in turn, make a positive impact on decision-making through data-driven insights.

The projects you'll find below showcase my ability to not only analyze data but also to present it in a clear, visually appealing manner, ensuring decision-makers can easily grasp the insights and take meaningful action. They represent my dedication to learning, my passion for data, and my commitment to making a difference through the power of information.
